  <h1 class="headline"> DJ ATMOS</h1>
  <p class="notice-text">
    VOVA ATMOS is sound producer, DJ, stage & light designer, and party instigator from Kyiv, Ukraine — currently based in Berlin.
    Producer, selector, and DJ digging through the raw, dusty corners of electronic music — from breaks, and latina techno, electro,  and other slower, unpolished sounds like low, downtempo, and trip-hop.

    Founder of LOWCUT — not just a party, but a loose alliance of DJs, producers, and sound rebels reclaiming space for slow tempos and deep frequencies.
    A fresh formation, still sharpening its claws and gathering its crowd — but the noise is growing, and something big is brewing.

    Also the brain behind underground gatherings like ElectroCat, KIT Home Party, and STEPLICA — small-scale, DIY parties born from the GreyCat Club community and powered by people, not profit.
    Operating between timelines, tuning shadow frequencies — crafting portals to places that never existed.
