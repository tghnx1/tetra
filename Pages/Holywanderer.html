  <h1 class="headline"> DJ HOLYWANDERER</h1>
  <p class="notice-text">
    Holywanderer crafts immersive dancefloor experiences rooted in Italo Body Music, Dark Disco, and raw analog electronics. A resident of Matreshka and Whoroscope, his sets balance hypnotic slow burns with muscular club energy — fusing EBM grooves, ghostly vocals, and cinematic tension.
    He has performed at Playground, Steplica, and Tropical Mates, building a signature sound that draws from post-punk aesthetics, rave heritage, and emotional release. His journey — including a surreal 1.5-year legal limbo nearly ending in deportation — adds a layer of urgency and depth to every performance.
