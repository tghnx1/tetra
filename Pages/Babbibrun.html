    A DJ from Ukraine who has discovered herself in various directions.

    from techno, electro, and breakbeat to dark disco, Latin American techno, UK bass, or techno house.

    She’s convinced that culture and creativity are ways of transmitting information on the level of DNA, only much faster. That’s why she shares her love for music and art.

    Founder of several projects in Ukraine, including the community “Muses” and the party series “Unexpected.”
    Also the initiator of one-off events like “Playground”, “Tropicalmates”,
    and owner of the project “Steplica.
